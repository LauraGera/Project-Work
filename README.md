# About the project
Cartes-Guides Campbell - La Bretagne
A glimpse into the dawn of French tourism

This digitization project was done as part of the Digitising Culture Heritage Materials course at the University of Bor√•s in spring 2023. It is dedicated to a very old document found in a private family collection, namely a touristic guide of the region Britanny (Bretagne) that circulated with a corresponding map at the beginning of the 20th century in France (Cartes-Guides Campbell). The map was not digitized as part of this project for lack of appropriate resources, however the possibility remains for future development.
